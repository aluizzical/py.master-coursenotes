# py.master-coursenotes
Hey there, so: I got myself a pack of 4 courses, called Python Master, from PyCodeBR, which are: Logic Master, Django Master, IA Master and Integration Master. And here i'll show you my notes, projects and stuff i learned with it or related to it. Hope you enjoy! 
WARNING: All of my notes are handwritten, the notes i've written related to the first course (Logic Master) are in portuguese, BUT, the other ones are in english.
